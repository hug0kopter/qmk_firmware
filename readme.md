# For spcgk530:

install qmk using: brew install qmk/qmk/qmk

Shorted the bottom third pin from the left of the MCU to the ground pin and while its shorted, plugged it into the computer to prepare for flashing

Used HorrorTroll's branch by using: qmk setup HorrorTroll/qmk_firmware -b sn32_240

(Here i guess in future iterations i can just qmk setup hugokopterek/qmk_firmware -b sn32_240)

went into qmk_firmware folder and then built the firmware using: make spcgear/gk530:default

Using qmk commands will not work cos the fork is super old

Used the ISP flasher tool (https://www.sonix.com.tw/article-en-998-21395)  -> SONIX_USB_MCU_ISP

VID: 0C45
PID: 7900

If you ever want to go to stock just download the updater from https://spcgear.com/en/software/, switch keyboard into boot mode and let the program do its thing. 

after qmk is installed u can just SPC_button + esc to reset into DFU and flash new firmware
